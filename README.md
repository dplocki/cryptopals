## The language change

Originaly I was implementing this project in Python. I have decided to switch because:

* I was learning Go in the meantime and I feel comfortable enought to switch
* I wanted to learn more about initialization of Go project and Go packages
* The challenges seems to require a lots of byte, bits even, operations, which Go seems to match better
* It was yet another of mine project in Python
